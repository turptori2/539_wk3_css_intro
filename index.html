    “When it comes to things to do in South Lake Tahoe, you can shred down the mountain from 10,067 ft. at Heavenly Mountain Resort’s peak or you can dive into the depths of Lake Tahoe. It’s more than 1600 ft. deep, making it one of the deepest lakes in North America. Needless to say, there’s plenty of things to do in Lake Tahoe above and below the surface.”

    “All parts of Lake Tahoe are beautiful and have something unique to offer. South Lake Tahoe is popular for its ski resorts like Heavenly, Sierra at Tahoe and Kirkwood ski resorts. South Lake Tahoe is also popular for its restaurants, shopping, casino resorts and vibrant nightlife.”

    </ul>
    </div>
    “Seoul is a city of contrasts in which the ancient and the modern harmoniously coexist. In one sense, it’s a city of the future with its cutting-edge technology, modern skyscrapers, and pop culture. In another sense, it’s a city of the past with its ancient palaces, temples, and traditions.”
